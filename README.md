## **üíª Technical Stack**

This project is built from the ground up using fundamental web technologies, with no external libraries or frameworks.

- **HTML5**: Provides the core structure and semantic layout for all game screens.
- **CSS3**:
  - Uses **Flexbox** and **Grid** for modern, responsive layouts.
  - Employs **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)** for easy theming (Light/Dark mode) and maintenance.
  - Includes **Keyframe Animations** for interactive UI effects.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**:
  - Powers all game logic, including question generation, state management, and user interaction.
  - Handles the mock authentication system and interacts with the browser's localStorage API for data persistence.

## **üìÇ Code Structure**

The entire application is contained within a single .html file, with clear separation of concerns.

1. **HTML Structure**: The <body> contains individual div elements that act as "screens" (e.g., #auth-login-screen, #game-screen). JavaScript controls which screen is visible at any time by toggling a .hidden class.
1. **CSS Styling**: An embedded <style> block in the <head> contains all the styling. It is organized into logical sections for clarity:
   1. CSS Variables (Theme Management)
   1. Base Styles & Animations
   1. Component-specific styles (Header, Buttons, Game Screen, etc.)
1. **JavaScript Logic**: An embedded <script> block at the end of the <body> handles all functionality. The script is organized into the following sections:
   1. **Authentication & Storage**: Manages the mock user database, login/registration logic, and guest sessions using localStorage.
   1. **Game State & Configuration**: Global objects that track the current game's settings (gameConfig) and state (gameState).
   1. **High Score & History Logic**: Functions for saving and retrieving user scores and game history.
   1. **Game Flow Functions**: Core logic for startGame(), generateQuestion(), checkAnswer(), and endGame().
   1. **Render & Display Functions**: UI-focused functions like showScreen() and updateDisplay() that manipulate the DOM.
   1. **Initialization & Event Listeners**: Sets up all the event handlers for buttons and user actions when the DOM is loaded.
